# Cloud Computing Guide


## What is Cloud Computing?
- **Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local on-premises infrastructure.

## How to Identify On-Prem vs. Cloud?
- **On premesis** = Managed on private physical servers/data centers.
- **Cloud** = Hosted by a cloud provider, accessible over the internet.
- **Hybrid** = Mix of both 
  - **HMLR use a hybrid setup. Why?**
    - Security & Compliance → Government agencies handle sensitive data and often keep critical systems on-premises for compliance.
    - Scalability → Cloud services help handle peak demand (e.g., property transactions).
    - Cost Efficiency → Hybrid cloud optimizes cost by using on-prem for core systems and cloud for scalable workloads.
    - Business Continuity → Cloud backups improve disaster recovery & resilience.
